  abstract = {This paper generalizes the control barrier function framework by replacing scalar-valued functions with matrix-valued ones. Specifically, we develop barrier conditions for safe sets defined by matrix inequalities -- both semidefinite and indefinite. Matrix inequalities can be used to describe a richer class of safe sets, including nonsmooth ones. The safety filters constructed from our proposed matrix control barrier functions via semidefinite programming (CBF-SDP) are shown to be continuous. Our matrix formulation naturally provides a continuous safety filter for Boolean-based control barrier functions, notably for disjunctions (OR), without relaxing the safe set. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with applications in drone network connectivity maintenance and nonsmooth obstacle avoidance, both in simulations and hardware experiments.},

  abstract = {Dynamic output feedback synthesis for systems with Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) models is presented. The study focuses on solving Parameter-Dependent (PD) Linear Matrix Inequalities with a grid-based method, providing a modification to existing techniques that improves performance, particularly when a small number of nodes or splines are used. Additionally, a novel approach is proposed for synthesizing LPV Dynamic Output Feedback controllers without relying on the time derivative of scheduling parameters. The gridding-based method is employed for solving the associated PD LMIs in estimating the L2 gain of the closed-loop system. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the distributed optimization of the finite condition number of the Laplacian matrix in multi-agent systems. The finite condition number, defined as the ratio of the largest to the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix, plays an important role in determining the convergence rate and performance of consensus algorithms, especially in discrete-time implementations. We propose a fully distributed algorithm by regulating the node weights. The approach leverages max consensus, distributed power iteration, and consensus-based normalization for eigenvalue and eigenvector estimation, requiring only local communication and computation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves performance comparable to centralized LMI-based optimization, significantly improving consensus speed and multi-agent system performance. The framework can be extended to edge weight optimization and the scenarios with non-simple eigenvalues, highlighting its scalability and practical applicability for large-scale networked systems.},
